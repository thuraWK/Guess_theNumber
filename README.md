# Guess_theNumber with Python

A Python-based interactive game where users guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range.
Players can choose from three difficulty levels, with different ranges and attempt limits.
The game provides dynamic hints after several attempts and tracks time taken to guess the number.
A leaderboard system ranks players based on their performance, storing the results in a JSON file.
Features include a replay option and error handling for user input.
The project demonstrates skills in Python, game logic, file handling, and basic algorithm implementation.
